# TubeSnake

Did you ever play snake over a YouTube video?
Yes. This feature existed, this extension aims to give it back.

## How it works

- Press "S" to start the game.
- use "A", "S", "D", "W" to move snake
- use "Q" to switch color, because some colors aren't visible on some backgrounds
- use "E" if you want to see your score on the top left corner
